fixpath
=======

*fixpath* is a set of scripts to fix the order and remove repeated and unwanted entries
in the `PATH` or `MANPATH`.  It was originally intended to deal with issues in the `PATH`
and `MANPATH` in X11 terminals on Mac OS 10.8 for [Fink](http://www.finkproject.org "Fink"),
but could easily be adapted for other scenarios.

This package is released into the public domain.
