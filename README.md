fixpath
=======

fixpath.pl is a handy script to fix the order and remove repeated and unwanted entries
in the PATH or MANPATH.  It was originally intended to deal with issues in the PATH
and MANPATH in X11 terminals on Mac OS 10.8 for Fink, but could easily be adapted for
other scenarios.

This package is released into the public domain.
